# crypto-buildsystem-Makefile
Modular C project using Makefiles to build two cryptographic modules: a static Caesar cipher library and a dynamic XOR cipher library. The build system auto-generates directories for objects, libraries, and the final executable, keeping the project organized and demonstrating custom build automation.
